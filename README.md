Proposal to add the group mark character to Unicode

The group mark character is part of the character set (BCD Interchange Code) used by the IBM 1401 and other computers. All the characters in this character set can be represented in Unicode, except for the group mark. Adding the group mark to Unicode would make discussion of the group mark in text easier, for example in email or web pages.

The group mark looks like this:

The full proposal is in [proposal.pdf](proposal.pdf?raw=true). A sample font with the group mark symbol is [GroupMark.ttf](GroupMark.ttf?raw=true), with the group mark at U+E000. A demo of the group mark displayed in HTML via a webfont is [here](http://righto.com/groupmark).

The proposal has been submitted to the Unicode committee for review as [document L2/15-083](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15083-group-mark.pdf)
